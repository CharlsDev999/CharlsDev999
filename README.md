Hello everyone!!
My name is Charls Basul and I am a future developer. I am currently studying Information Technology at the Rizal Technological University, and am very passionate about coding. I am looking to expand my knowledge in programming and software development by contributing to open source projects on GitHub. I am excited to learn more and contribute to the open source community. Thank you for your time!
